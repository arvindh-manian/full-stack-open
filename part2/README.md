# Chapter 2

This was my repository for the second chapter of FullStackOpen. In this section, we looked at rendering a collection, modules (how to create them/how to import them), forms, fetching data from a server (using GET requests through `axios`), altering data in a server (using DELETE, PUT, and POST requests, again through `axios`), and adding styling to React apps.

## Projects

Probably the project I'm most proud of in this section was the [countries](https://github.com/arvindh-manian/full-stack-open/tree/main/part2/countries) one. I interacted with online APIs to display information about various countries. Fun stuff!

Besides that, [phonebook](https://github.com/arvindh-manian/full-stack-open/tree/main/part2/phonebook) was pretty fun. That was my first use of CRUD operations in a while, so it was a nice refresher.
