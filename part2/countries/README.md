# Countries

This was probably the coolest project in this unit! Basically, I interacted with the [restcountries](https://restcountries.com/) online API (using REST principles, as the name implies) to display information about various countries. I then used data from that to fetch weather information about the countries' capital cities using [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
