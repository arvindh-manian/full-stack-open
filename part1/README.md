# Chapter 1

This was the first real chapter of FullStackOpen! In this one, the course went through a basic introduction to React and JS, discussed component state and event handlers, and introduced hooks and debugging techniques.

# Projects

I don't think any of these projects were *super* interesting. [Anecdotes](https://github.com/arvindh-manian/full-stack-open/tree/main/part1/anecdotes) was probably the most memorable, and that was just basically a first test of how to use hooks.
