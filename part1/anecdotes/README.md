# Anecdotes

In the grand scheme of things, this was a pretty easy project. During this project, I created a simple web app that displayed a random anecdote from a predefined list and allowed users to vote on it. Since this module was before the introduction of databases (that occurred in [chapter 2](https://github.com/arvindh-manian/full-stack-open/tree/main/part2)), all of the votes were stored client-side.
