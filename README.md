# Full-Stack-Open

This is the repository to store my assignments and submissions for the [University of Helsinki Full Stack Open Course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

# Repository format
- Each chapter has a corresponding folder
- The folders (except for part0, as that was introductory) have top-level READMEs that explain the concepts from that unit and discuss the completed projects
- Projects mentioned in the READMEs have associated READMEs that go a bit more in-depth about the technologies and concepts applied in their creations
- There are more projects in each chapter, but I've only opted to include the ones that
    - Seemed to be significant in terms of new content
    - Didn't provide a lot of code for me to start with
